# OpenTrace for iOS

## Installation

* Requires XCode 11.4.1 and Ruby (MacOS includes Ruby already)
* Install the Mint package manager `brew install mint`
* From this directory run `rake opentrace`

The rake task will install all dependencies, build the project, and open XCode
(will take a while on the first run).
